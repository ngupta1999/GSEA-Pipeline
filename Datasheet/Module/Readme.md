## What's in there
- **Modules contains the different genes relevant with our analysis.**
- **Different modules have different densities.**
- **Here density means how closely genes are stacked in a network.**
- **Genes which are highy stacks tends to form a cluster which might be invovled in a common pathway.**
- **Selection of the module density is subjected to Phenotype.**
